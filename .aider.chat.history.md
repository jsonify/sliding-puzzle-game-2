#### can we add some more randomness to the puzzle's solution?  

Based on your request to add more randomness to the puzzle's solution, the most likely files that would need to be modified are:

1. `src/components/SlidePuzzle/index.tsx` - This likely contains the core puzzle logic and tile movement code
2. `src/components/SlidePuzzle/test.tsx` - Tests may need updating if we change the puzzle behavior

Please add these files to the chat so I can propose specific changes to add more randomness to the puzzle solution. I'll wait for you to share the files before suggesting any edits.

I'll help add more randomness to the puzzle solution. Looking at the code, we can modify the `initializeBoard` function in `index.tsx` to create more varied starting positions. Here's how we can do it:

1. Add more shuffle iterations
2. Add a random number of random moves to the initial board
3. Ensure the puzzle remains solvable

Here are the changes:

src/components/SlidePuzzle/index.tsx
```typescript
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    // Keep shuffling until we get a different order than solution
    let shuffledTiles: Tile[]
    const sortedTiles = [...tiles].sort((a, b) => a.id - b.id)
    
    do {
      shuffledTiles = shuffle(tiles)
    } while (shuffledTiles.every((tile, i) => tile.id === sortedTiles[i].id))
=======
    // Create sorted tiles for solution
    const sortedTiles = [...tiles].sort((a, b) => a.id - b.id)
    
    // Shuffle multiple times for more randomness
    let shuffledTiles = [...tiles]
    for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
      shuffledTiles = shuffle(shuffledTiles)
    }
    
    // Create initial board with shuffled tiles
    let newBoard: (Tile | null)[][] = []
    let tileIndex = 0
    
    for (let i = 0; i < GRID_SIZE; i++) {
      const row: (Tile | null)[] = []
      for (let j = 0; j < GRID_SIZE; j++) {
        if (i === GRID_SIZE - 1 && j === GRID_SIZE - 1) {
          row.push(null) // Empty tile
        } else {
          row.push(shuffledTiles[tileIndex++])
        }
      }
      newBoard.push(row)
    }
    
    // Make random moves to further randomize the board
    const randomMoves = Math.floor(Math.random() * 50) + 25 // Between 25-75 moves
    for (let i = 0; i < randomMoves; i++) {
      // Find all movable tiles
      const movableTiles: Position[] = []
      for (let row = 0; row < GRID_SIZE; row++) {
        for (let col = 0; col < GRID_SIZE; col++) {
          if (canMoveTile(row, col) && newBoard[row][col] !== null) {
            movableTiles.push({ row, col })
          }
        }
      }
      
      // Pick a random movable tile and move it
      if (movableTiles.length > 0) {
        const randomIndex = Math.floor(Math.random() * movableTiles.length)
        const { row, col } = movableTiles[randomIndex]
        moveTile(row, col, newBoard)
      }
    }
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

src/components/SlidePuzzle/index.tsx
```typescript
<<<<<<< SEARCH
  const moveTile = (row: number, col: number) => {
    if (!canMoveTile(row, col)) return
  
    const newBoard = [...board.map(row => [...row])]
=======
  const moveTile = (row: number, col: number, boardToUpdate?: (Tile | null)[][]) => {
    if (!canMoveTile(row, col)) return
  
    const newBoard = boardToUpdate ? boardToUpdate : [...board.map(row => [...row])]
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

These changes will:

1. Increase the number of shuffle iterations from 1 to 10
2. Add between 25-75 random moves to the initial board state
3. Keep the puzzle solvable by only making valid moves
4. Add an optional parameter to moveTile to allow modifying a specific board state

The tests should still pass since we're maintaining the puzzle's solvability, just creating more varied starting positions. The increased randomness will make the puzzle more challenging and interesting to solve.

Let me know if you'd like me to explain any part of these changes in more detail!

#### Uncaught SyntaxError: Identifier 'newBoard' has already been declared  

Ah, I see the issue - there's a duplicate declaration of `newBoard` in the `initializeBoard` function. Let me fix that:

src/components/SlidePuzzle/index.tsx
```typescript
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    // Create the board with randomized tiles
    const newBoard: (Tile | null)[][] = []
    let tileIndex = 0
    
    for (let i = 0; i < GRID_SIZE; i++) {
      const row: (Tile | null)[] = []
      for (let j = 0; j < GRID_SIZE; j++) {
        if (i === GRID_SIZE - 1 && j === GRID_SIZE - 1) {
          row.push(null) // Empty tile
        } else {
          row.push(shuffledTiles[tileIndex++])
        }
      }
      newBoard.push(row)
    }
=======
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This removes the duplicate board initialization code that was causing the error. The board is already initialized earlier in the function with the random moves applied, so we don't need to create it again.

The function now:
1. Creates and shuffles tiles
2. Creates initial board with shuffled tiles
3. Applies random moves to further randomize
4. Creates solution board
5. Sets the board and solution states

Let me know if you see any other issues!

#### what I wanted was for the solution to be more random each game. Now our puzzle starts out with 4 blanks along the far right column and 4 blanks along the bottom row.
